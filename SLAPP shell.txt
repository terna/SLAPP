You are supposed to have downloaded SLAPP as a zip file and to have unzipped it.

SLAPP, as Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python, has its full implementation
in folder # 6, “6 objectSwarmObserverAgents_AESOP_turtleLib_NetworkX”.

You can use it as an agent-based shell, keeping unmodified its basic structure,
contained into the $$slapp$$ folder.

Install the required libraries (as explained in the two "warning files"
the you find in the folder # 6 and, above all, in the Appendix A of the
Reference Handbook that you can find in the main folder of the SLAPP
distribution).

Then, from the main folder of SLAPP, run

python runShell.py

and chose one of the three project examples:

basic

school

production

(For a graphical presentation, please look at README.md in the main SLAPP folder.)

There are also a 'debug' project and a 'basic2classes' one: have a look
to the Reference Manual for their contents.

Alternatively, you can use Jupyter to run SLAPP: loot at README.md
