Here you have both a tutorial on agent-based programming foundations and an
agent-based simulation shell, coming from the Swarm (www.swarm.org) project,
and named SLAPP for Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python.

You can find SLAPP as an Agent-based Model (ABM) shell, in the folder # 6.

Both the basic scheme of the tutorial, and all the files with the "Swarm_original"
prefix in their names, are coming from the tutorial that was distributed by the
Swarm Development Group via the swarmapps file (the last version, that we use here,
is swarmapps-objc-2.2-3.tar.gz).

Those files are unmodified, but the correction of a few typos.

You can find them on line at
