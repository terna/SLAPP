What version of Python do you use?

**[SLAPP3](https://terna.github.io/SLAPP3) uses Python 3**

**[SLAPP2](https://terna.github.io/SLAPP2) uses Python 2**


***Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python***

At [SLAPP 3](https://terna.github.io/SLAPP3), you have SLAPP running in Python 3 (in the [SLAPP repository](http://terna.to.it/slapp_dep/) you have a lot related material and a large set of old versions; the [2.0](https://terna.github.io/SLAPP2).x version is the last one related to Python 2).

We have here also a [**Reference Handbook**](https://github.com/terna/SLAPP/blob/v.3.0/SLAPP_Reference_Handbook.pdf) (it is still a draft and has to be improved).

Five chapters of the book of Boero, R., Morini, M., Sonnessa, M., and Terna, P.,  [Agent-based Models of the Economy - From Theories to Applications](http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/agentbased-models-of-the-economy-/?K=9781137339805), are related to SLAPP.

A recent paper [(Business Cycle in a Macromodel with Oligopoly and Agents' Heterogeneity: An Agent-Based Approach, 2017)](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s40797-017-0058-y?author_access_token=vjDZsvCU0oSWIIYZ3I29c_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7_M5DUq8hCn77TEQ7dIoockg0M5bs0KRNXV7xG9MosbmD22MVHEyYi2Hagw-CHS6AIbo9_gdi2cn_YQ9rtzqbZqjqBJQ0qb2sTTlyZLgGMUw==) of M.Mazzoli, M.Morini, and P.Terna, is using SLAPP as agent-based modeling shell.

We have also a [running version of SLAPP](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/terna/SLAPP3/master?filepath=iRunShellOnline.ipynb), via the wonderful [Binder project](https://beta.mybinder.org/): try it!

In October 2016 I taught a course on *Agent-Based Simulation* for the [Master in Data Science for Complex Economic Systems, MADAS](http://www.madas.carloalberto.org/) and for the [Vilfredo Pareto Doctorate in Economics](http://www.sde.unito.it/). I have introduced SLAPP both as a tutorial in agent-based programming and a simulation shell, with some comparative references to NetLogo. Look [here](http://terna.to.it/sim/2016/) for the contents and videos of the course; have also a preliminary look to the [_README.txt](http://terna.to.it/sim/2016/_README.txt) file.  
The file 2.mp4 of lesson 4 contains, from minute 41, a short introduction to the use of SLAPP online.
